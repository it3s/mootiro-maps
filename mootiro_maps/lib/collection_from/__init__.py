class CollectionFrom(models.GeometryCollectionField):
    """
    Creates a GeometryCollection pseudo-field from the provided
    component fields. When accessed, the CollectionFrom field will
    return a GeometryCollection from the provided component fields.
    When set to a value (upon model save) the geometries contained in
    the CollectionFrom field are broken out and placed into their
    relevant component fields.

    Example::

        class MyModel(models.Model):
            points = models.MultiPointField()
            lines = models.MultiLineStringField()
            polys = models.MultiPolygonField()
            geom = CollectionFrom(points='points', lines='lines',
                polys='polys')

    Then when you access the 'geom' attribute on instances of MyModel
    you'll get a GeometryCollection with your points, lines and polys.
    When you set the 'geom' attribute to a GeometryCollection and save
    an instance of MyModel the GeometryCollection is broken into points,
    lines and polygons and placed into the provided fields.

    This field is useful when you want to deal with GeometryCollections
    but still must maintain separate geometry fields on the model. For
    instance, GeoDjango does not currently allow you to filter (with
    geometry operations) based on GeometryCollections due to issues
    with the underlying libraries. Someday this may be fixed. But
    until then, we've got this Field.

    NOTES: This field will add a column to the db, but it won't ever
           store anything there except null. There's probably a way
           around this. TODO.
